# Conquest Reforged Axiom Script Brushes

## Overview
This is a collection of Script Brushes for Axiom, specifically designed for use with the Conquest Reforged Mod.

### Conquest Plants Brush
This brush allows you to place plants on layered terrain with a variety of customizable options, including noise, randomness, and the ability to create two- or three-block-tall plants. Additionally, the brush features an eraser mode for easily removing unwanted plants and a replace mode for directly painting over existing foliage.
I've also included a comprehensive list of foliage blocks (`foliageTable.lua`) that can be integrated into the script. Detailed instructions on how to use this list are provided within the brush script itself.

### Conquest Crops Brush
This brush is similar to the Conquest Plants Brush but is designed specifically for placing crops, allowing you to set a minimum and maximum age. Plants of different ages will be placed according to a noise pattern (with optional randomness), just like in the Conquest Plants Brush. An eraser and replace mode is also featured.

### Conquest Layers Brush
This brush allows you to paint layered terrain similar to painting normal terrain using the Noise Painter.

## Installation
To use the brush, copy the contents of the `.lua` files directly into the Lua Script Brush Console within the Axiom Mod. To save different default presets for a brush, you have to directly change the default values in the code. Further explanations on how this is done are found in the `.lua` files.
