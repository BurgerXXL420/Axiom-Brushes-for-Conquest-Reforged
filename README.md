# Conquest Reforged Axiom Script Brushes

## Overview
This is a collection of Script Brushes for Axiom specifically designed for use within the Conquest Reforged Mod.

### Conquest Plants Brush
This brush allows you to place plants on layered terrain with a variety of customizable options, including noise, randomness, and the ability to create two- or three-tall plants. Additionally, the brush features an eraser mode for easily removing unwanted plants.
I've also included a comprehensive list of foliage blocks (`foliageTable.txt`) that can be integrated into the script. Detailed instructions on how to use this list are provided within the brush script itself.

### Layer Brush
This brush allows you to paint layered terrain similar to painting normal terrain using the Noise Painter. 

## Installation
To use the brush, copy the contents of the `.lua` files directly into the Lua Script Brush Console within the Axiom Mod. Alternativley, you can place the `.nbt` files in the `script_brush` folder located at: `...\config\axiom\tool_presets\script_brush` (where `...` is your Minecraft instance folder) and restart Minecraft.
